### SPA Universe

I created a simple app using the concept of single page application, even though it's more driven by .HTML and basic .JS the navigation allow us to change pages, and grasp the meaning and how SPA works in a easier way. 

In this project I could learn a couple of things:

- what is SPA and how useful it is.
- and a basic understand of how to map the Routes.
- how to handle promises with fetch().then()
